## Key Benefits for This Athlete
✓ High protein from varied plant sources (tofu, legumes, seeds, protein powder)  
✓ Adequate carbs for training energy and recovery  
✓ Timing supports pre/post-workout nutrition  
✓ Omega-3s from seeds and nuts for inflammation management  
✓ 100% vegan-compliant</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution successfully meets all mandatory requirements with a complete, practical one-day vegan meal plan that includes exact portions, timing, and macronutrient information. All meals are verified vegan-compliant and use appropriate plant-based protein sources for athletic performance. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the stated daily macronutrient targets (110g protein, 280g carbs) and what the actual meal plan delivers (100g protein, 252g carbs), indicating a calculation or planning error. Despite this inconsistency, the actual meal plan itself is nutritionally sound and appropriate for the athlete's profile. The caloric intake is suitable for weight maintenance while supporting training demands.</td>
