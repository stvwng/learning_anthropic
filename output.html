## **Key Performance Notes**

✅ **Protein timing:** Distributed across 6 eating occasions  
✅ **Pre-workout:** Simple carbs + fat for sustained energy  
✅ **Post-workout:** Fast carbs + protein within 1 hour for recovery  
✅ **Before bed:** Slow-digesting protein (cottage cheese) for overnight recovery  
✅ **Budget-friendly:** Uses affordable staples (eggs, rice, chicken, oats)</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution comprehensively satisfies all mandatory requirements with precise daily totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and six complete meals with exact portions and timing. The protein target of 188g (2.2g/kg) exceeds the 136-187g criterion, and the meal structure demonstrates sophisticated understanding of nutrient timing for muscle building. Pre-workout and post-workout nutrition are strategically positioned with appropriate macronutrient ratios. The foods listed are realistic, athlete-appropriate, and budget-conscious. While minor enhancements like hydration guidance and meal flexibility could improve practical utility, these are not required by the stated criteria. The solution fully meets both mandatory and secondary criteria without deficiencies.</td>

## NOTES FOR MARATHON TRAINING
✓ High carb load (65%) sustains endurance energy  
✓ Protein (140g) supports muscle recovery  
✓ Timing spreads calories to maintain steady blood sugar  
✓ Simple carbs pre/post-training, complex carbs with meals  
✓ Budget-friendly staples: oats, rice, chicken, eggs, bananas</pre></td>
                <td class="score-col"><span class="score score-high">9</span></td>
                <td class="reasoning">The solution comprehensively meets all mandatory requirements with precise daily totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and specific meal timing with exact portions. The carbohydrate emphasis (62.9%) falls squarely within the 55-65% target and appropriately prioritizes glycogen loading for marathon training. All meals are practical and realistic for an athlete. Minor inconsistencies exist between stated macronutrient goals (100-115g protein, 24-25% fat) and actual delivery (140g protein, 20.4% fat), but these are not significant enough to undermine the plan's effectiveness. The solution demonstrates strong understanding of endurance nutrition principles and provides actionable guidance.</td>

## Key Nutrition Notes
✓ **Protein sources:** Legumes, quinoa, tofu, nuts, seeds, vegan powder  
✓ **B12:** Consider a supplement or B12-fortified plant milk  
✓ **Iron:** Pair legumes with vitamin C (citrus, tomatoes, peppers)  
✓ **Timing:** Carbs + protein before/after intense training  
✓ **Budget:** Bulk oats, beans, rice, and seasonal produce to minimize costs</pre></td>
                <td class="score-col"><span class="score score-high">9</span></td>
                <td class="reasoning">The solution comprehensively meets all mandatory requirements with precise calorie totals, detailed macronutrient breakdowns, and specific meals with portions and timing. All meals are verified vegan. The macronutrient distribution strongly supports athletic performance with adequate plant-based protein sources. The meal plan is practical and realistic for a single day with appropriate meal timing around training. The caloric target is slightly elevated for weight maintenance but reasonable given high-intensity training demands. Secondary criteria are well-addressed with thoughtful nutritional notes and timing considerations. Minor weaknesses exist in caloric precision for the stated goal and emphasis on B12 supplementation, but these do not significantly detract from an otherwise comprehensive and well-executed plan.</td>
