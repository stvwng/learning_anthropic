                <td class="output"><pre># Nutrition Plan for High-Intensity Training (Vegan)

## Daily Calorie & Macro Targets
- **Calories**: ~2,000-2,200/day (adjust based on training intensity)
- **Protein**: 100-130g/day (1.9-2.5g per kg body weight for muscle maintenance)
- **Carbs**: 225-275g/day (fuel for high-intensity work)
- **Fat**: 55-65g/day (essential functions)

## Key Protein Sources
- **Legumes**: lentils, chickpeas, black beans, peas
- **Tofu/Tempeh**: versatile, complete proteins
- **Nuts & Seeds**: almonds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, chia
- **Whole Grains**: quinoa, oats (higher protein varieties)
- **Vegan Protein**: plant-based powders (pea, rice, hemp blends)

## Sample Daily Structure
- **Breakfast**: Oatmeal + almond butter + berries + hemp seeds
- **Snack**: Hummus + vegetables + nuts
- **Lunch**: Tofu stir-fry + brown rice + broccoli
- **Snack**: Protein smoothie (plant milk, protein powder, banana)
- **Dinner**: Lentil curry + quinoa + leafy greens

## Important Notes
- **B12 supplement** required (vegan-specific)
- Monitor iron intake; pair plant sources with vitamin C
- Ensure omega-3s (flaxseeds, walnuts, or algae supplement)
- Time carbs around training sessions

## Daily Calorie & Macro Targets

**Estimated Daily Needs: ~2,800-3,000 calories**

| Macro | Amount | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Protein** | 170-185g (2.0-2.2g/kg) | Muscle synthesis & recovery |
| **Carbs** | 350-400g | Energy for training & recovery |
| **Fat** | 80-100g | Hormone production & health |

---

## Protein Timing Around Workouts

### Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)
- **40-50g carbs + 20-30g protein**
- Examples: Chicken + rice, oats with protein powder, banana with Greek yogurt

### Post-Workout (within 2 hours)
- **40-50g carbs + 30-40g protein**
- Examples: Whey protein shake with fruit, lean meat with sweet potato, Greek yogurt with granola

## Daily Meal Structure Example

| Meal | Sample Foods |
|------|-------------|
| **Breakfast** | Eggs, oats, berries, olive oil |
| **Snack 1** | Greek yogurt, almonds |
| **Lunch** | Chicken breast, rice, broccoli |
| **Pre-Workout** | Banana, protein shake |
| **Post-Workout** | Whey protein, dextrose/fruit |
| **Dinner** | Lean beef/salmon, sweet potato, vegetables |
| **Evening** | Casein protein or cottage cheese |

---

## Key Foods to Prioritize

✅ **Proteins:** Chicken, beef, salmon, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese  
✅ **Carbs:** Rice, oats, sweet potatoes, whole wheat bread  
✅ **Fats:** Olive oil, avocados, nuts, fatty fish  
✅ **Vegetables:** Broccoli, spinach, peppers (micronutrients & fiber)

**Track intake for 2-3 weeks** to dial in exact calories based on strength gains and body composition changes.</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution provides excellent guidance on protein targets, workout nutrition timing, and food choices. However, it fundamentally fails the mandatory requirements by not delivering a complete one-day meal plan with exact foods, portions, and timing. The solution reads as a general framework/template rather than an actual meal plan. While it states 'Daily Meal Structure Example,' this is merely a list of meal types without specific quantities, times, or a coherent daily schedule. The macronutrient breakdown is presented as ranges rather than concrete totals for the proposed day. A proper solution would show something like: 'Breakfast 7:00am: 3 eggs, 50g oats, 100g berries' with cumulative daily totals, not just categories and examples.</td>

## Key Race-Specific Tips

✓ **Hydration:** 3-4L water daily + electrolyte drinks during long runs  
✓ **Timing:** Eat carbs within 30min post-run  
✓ **Practice:** Test all race-day foods during training  
✓ **Long runs:** Consume 30-60g carbs/hour during runs >90min
