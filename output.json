    "reasoning": "The solution fails to meet mandatory requirements. While it demonstrates strong nutritional knowledge and provides appropriate macro targets for the athlete's goals, it does not deliver what was explicitly requested: a one-day meal plan with exact foods, portions, timing, and a daily calorie/macro breakdown. The sample meals are illustrative examples rather than a complete, quantified plan. The solution reads more as nutritional guidance than an actual meal plan. This is a fundamental gap between what was asked for and what was delivered."

    "reasoning": "The solution provides excellent guidance on protein targets, workout nutrition timing, and food choices. However, it fundamentally fails the mandatory requirements by not delivering a complete one-day meal plan with exact foods, portions, and timing. The solution reads as a general framework/template rather than an actual meal plan. While it states 'Daily Meal Structure Example,' this is merely a list of meal types without specific quantities, times, or a coherent daily schedule. The macronutrient breakdown is presented as ranges rather than concrete totals for the proposed day. A proper solution would show something like: 'Breakfast 7:00am: 3 eggs, 50g oats, 100g berries' with cumulative daily totals, not just categories and examples."
