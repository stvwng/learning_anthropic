The protein intake (170g) correctly targets the muscle-building goal and falls squarely within the specified 136-187g range. Pre-workout and post-workout meals are strategically positioned with appropriate macronutrient ratios. The plan uses realistic, athlete-appropriate foods and includes practical nutrition timing notes. While minor improvements could address workout schedule flexibility and micronutrient details, these are secondary considerations that don't detract from meeting the core criteria."

All meals are verified vegan-compliant and use appropriate plant-based protein sources for athletic performance. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the stated daily macronutrient targets (110g protein, 280g carbs) and what the actual meal plan delivers (100g protein, 252g carbs), indicating a calculation or planning error. Despite this inconsistency, the actual meal plan itself is nutritionally sound and appropriate for the athlete's profile. The caloric intake is suitable for weight maintenance while supporting training demands."
