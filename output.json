The protein target of 188g (2.2g/kg) exceeds the 136-187g criterion, and the meal structure demonstrates sophisticated understanding of nutrient timing for muscle building. Pre-workout and post-workout nutrition are strategically positioned with appropriate macronutrient ratios. The foods listed are realistic, athlete-appropriate, and budget-conscious. While minor enhancements like hydration guidance and meal flexibility could improve practical utility, these are not required by the stated criteria. The solution fully meets both mandatory and secondary criteria without deficiencies."
