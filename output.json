    "score": 10,
    "reasoning": "The solution fully satisfies all mandatory requirements: it provides a complete daily calorie total (3,170 kcal), detailed macronutrient breakdown (188g protein, 400g carbs, 83g fat), and six meals with exact foods, portions, and specific timing throughout the day. The protein intake of 188g exceeds the minimum requirement of 136g and falls within the optimal 136-187g range specified. Pre-workout and post-workout nutrition is strategically planned with appropriate macronutrient timing for muscle synthesis and recovery. All meals feature realistic, athlete-appropriate foods suitable for a weightlifter. The meal plan is well-organized, practical, and includes helpful performance notes. The only minor issue is a negligible 30 kcal shortfall from the stated 3,200 kcal target, which is immaterial. The solution meets all secondary criteria comprehensively."

    "reasoning": "The solution successfully meets all mandatory requirements with excellent vegan compliance, detailed portions, and proper meal timing. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the stated daily nutrition targets (2,080 kcal) and the actual meal plan totals (2,480 kcal), representing a 19% caloric overage. While the macronutrient distribution is reasonable for athletic performance, the failure to align actual delivery with stated targets is a material inconsistency. The plan is practical and well-organized, but the numerical mismatch undermines confidence in the nutritional prescription for the stated goal of weight maintenance."

The carbohydrate percentage (62.4%) falls squarely within the required 55-65% range and supports marathon training goals. The meal plan is practical, realistic, and demonstrates understanding of endurance nutrition principles (pre-run fueling, post-run recovery windows, meal frequency). The primary weaknesses are the balance between complex and refined carbs (though refined carbs are justified for quick energy in some contexts) and an incomplete hydration section. These are minor issues that don't undermine the core quality of the plan."
